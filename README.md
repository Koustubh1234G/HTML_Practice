# BSC CS 3 Year AllPracticals
This is a project dedicated to my friends and classmates, so that they do not lack the opportunity to understand or learn basics and foundation of web-dev. This took me a week to make simple template and design, now its simple that when ever I get time I update it with new questions for practice.

### Content
- There are several questions of HTML, CSS, JS.
- These questions start from very basics to foundation level.
- They are not hard to understand once you get the hang of doing and practicing it.

### Grateful
I am grateful to our professor for teaching these new tech stuff and web-dev. They teach us very good that I am able to show the work, the ideas to all here.
Thank you!!!
